### Project Introduction
This project uses a sales dataset containing information about orders, products, discounts, customers, and inventory.  
It is designed for practicing SQL through business-focused case questions.  
By working with this dataset, I aim to apply SQL techniques such as aggregation, ranking, cohort analysis, and growth calculations to generate insights similar to real-world data analytics tasks.

### üîç Insights
- Top revenue drivers: Road Bikes, Mountain Bikes, and Touring Bikes consistently generate the highest sales.
- Accessories (Helmets, Jerseys, Tires & Tubes) show strong and steady demand, supporting main product categories.
- Certain months (e.g., Jun 2014) show sharp declines in multiple subcategories, possibly due to seasonality or missing data.
- Overall, from mid-2013 to mid-2014, bike categories dominate revenue, while accessories provide stable recurring sales.

### üí° Recommendations
- Focus marketing and promotions on top categories (Road/Mountain/Touring Bikes) to sustain revenue growth.
- Leverage cross-selling with accessories (Helmets, Jerseys, Tires & Tubes) to boost average order value.
- Monitor seasonal trends to optimize inventory and avoid overstock/stockouts during low-demand periods.
- Expand analysis across all months to confirm seasonality patterns and long-term growth opportunities.

  SELECT 
      FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%Y", a.ModifiedDate) AS yr,
      c.Name,
      SUM(a.OrderQty) AS qty_item
  FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` a 
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` b 
    ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` c 
    ON CAST(b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT64) = c.ProductSubcategoryID
  GROUP BY 1,2
),

sale_diff AS (
  SELECT 
    yr,
    Name,
    qty_item,
    LEAD(qty_item) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY yr DESC) AS prv_qty,
    ROUND(qty_item / CAST(LEAD(qty_item) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY yr DESC) AS FLOAT64) - 1, 2) AS qty_diff
  FROM sale_info
),

  SELECT 
    yr,
    Name,
    qty_item,
    prv_qty,
    qty_diff,

  FROM sale_diff
)

SELECT 
  Name,
  qty_item,
  prv_qty,

| 2    | Socks            | 2,724    | 523      | 421%           |
| 3    | Road Frames      | 5,564    | 1,137    | 389%           |

### üîç Insights
- Mountain Frames saw the highest growth (+521%), followed by Socks and Road Frames.
- The top 3 categories all experienced very strong YoY increases compared to previous periods.

### üí° Recommendations
- Allocate more inventory and marketing to Mountain Frames, Socks, and Road Frames to sustain growth.
- Investigate drivers of demand (promotions, seasonality, product launches) to replicate success in other categories.

```
| Year | Subcategory | Total Discount Cost |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| 2012 | Helmets     | 149.72               |
| 2013 | Helmets     | 543.22               |
### üîç Insights
- Helmet discount cost increased sharply from 2012 (149.7) to 2013 (543.2).
- This suggests higher promotion or seasonal discount activity on Helmets in 2013.

### üîç Insights
- Customer acquisition is strong at M - 0 .
- Retention drops sharply from M - 1 onward .
- Some cohorts (like month 1, M - 3 = 252) show a slight spike of re-engagement, possibly due to campaigns or seasonality.
- By later months, most cohorts shrink to very small numbers, indicating limited long-term retention.

‚∏ª

üí° Recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Strengthen onboarding & engagement in the first month to reduce early churn.
	‚Ä¢	Analyze re-engagement campaigns (like cohort 1 at M - 3) and replicate what worked.
	‚Ä¢	Introduce loyalty or subscription programs to improve long-term customer retention.
	‚Ä¢	Segment churned users and run targeted win-back campaigns.
